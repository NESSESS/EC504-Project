# EC504-Project

Run the make file to generate executable called ```trees```.

This executable can do two things:

1. test/demo insertion and successor opertaions on an x-fast and y-fast tries. 
2. Compare run time between x-fast and y-fast tries and BSTs.

## Insertion and Successor Demo

Included in this repo are two text files. 

```numbers.txt``` includes a list of numbers to insert into the tries.

```successor.txt``` includes a list of numbers we want to call sucessor operation on after the insetions.

execute:

```
./trees demo numbers.txt successor.txt
```

This will produce the following output:

```

For the Y-fast Trie, there is only one BST and one value in the X-Fast Trie because each BST can hold up to 128 numbers. You would have to insert more than 128 numbers into the Y-fast Trie to see multiple BSTs.

*Important*: Y-fast Tries only store data in the BSTs. The stuff in the top-level X-fast trie is auxiliary information.

For the X-Fast Trie, note that there are 64 levels because we use 64 bit integers. All the top levels are empty because we use small integers. Small integers have a lot of zeros in front. 

*Important*: X-Fast Tries only store data in the bottom level (level 64). The other levels store auxiliary information.

## Timing Comparison

execute the following to generate timing comparison between the Y-fast trie, X-fast trie, and BST:

```
./trees timer
```

This produces the results in file ```results.csv```

For every value of N and every data structure, we insert N integers and perform N successor operations. 

The timings are outputted in csv format.

*Note:* When plotting, divide by N to get average operation time. 

Times are in seconds.
